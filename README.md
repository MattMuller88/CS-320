Work from the SNHU course CS-320: Software Test Automation and QA


Throughout my work in this course, I ensured that my software was functional through the use of JUnit tests. I wrote tests that would prove that all of the requirements laid out for a project were being met. A part of this was running the tests with coverage to make sure that all aspects of the program were tested. This plays right into the incorporation of user needs into a program. Each test that I created would ensure that a desired aspect of the project was functioning as intended. 

Much of my approach to developing software revolves around adherence to the satisfaction of the requirements that I am presented with. My first objective is to design a system with all of the functionality that is demanded of it. After this, I begin to work on things like formatting outputs to look the best they can and enhancing code readability.
